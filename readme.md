## ZK!

### Crates
[Protocols](/protocols) - zk tooling and protocol implementation currently includes: 
- uni poly, 
- multilinear poly, 
- sumcheck, 
- gkr, 
- r1cs to gkr circuit, 
- circom adapater for r1cs to gkr circuit.  

[Circom GKR](/circom-gkr) -  CLI wrapper for circom+gkr prover / verifier.

### Research Direction
- Custom gates in GKR
- Recursive GKR proofs

🤷🏽‍♂️ Maybe?? 
- Integrating lookups?
- GKR based ZKVM?

### Current Status
Pushing the currently implemented protocols to their performance limit (making these things fast 🚀).
