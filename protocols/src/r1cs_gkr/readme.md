### Term
A term is a variable multiplied by some constant e.g. 2a, 5b, 14c, d (when constant equals 1).

### Constraint
A constraint is an equation involving one or more terms 
e.g a + 2b = 5c + d. The constraint is satisfied if there exists values for a, b, c and d such that the LHS == RHS.

### Reduced Constraints
A reduced constraint has a maximum of 3 terms
